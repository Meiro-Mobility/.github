# Yuja Mobility Platform

**Welcome to Yuja!** We're revolutionizing paratransit with a modern, technology-driven platform that reimagines how auto-rickshaws, shuttles, and informal transport systems operate. Yuja empowers drivers and passengers alike by making it easier, faster, and more sustainable to manage and access street-hail and app-hail rides.

### 🌍 **Our Vision**  
At Yuja, we're driven by the belief that transportation should be efficient, inclusive, and sustainable. By harnessing cutting-edge technology, we’re making it easier for cities to build smarter paratransit networks and advance UN Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG 8, SDG 9, and SDG 11.

### 🚀 **Why Yuja?**  
Yuja is **more than just a mobility app**. We provide an **operating system for paratransit**, bridging the gap between informal transit modes and modern transportation needs.

- **For Drivers**: Increase revenue, reduce downtime, and streamline operations with real-time productivity tools and demand insights.
- **For Riders**: Enjoy easy access to reliable street-hail and app-hail rides with standardized fare pricing with no surcharged.
- **For Cities**: Enable smarter transport management, reduce congestion, and advance sustainability goals with our data-driven solutions.

### 🧠 **Technology Behind Yuja**  
Our platform is powered by a **proprietary tech stack** designed to address the unique needs of informal transit systems:

- **In-app metering**: Lightweight and robust in-app methods for distance estimation without dependence on maps, crucial for taking smart mobility to the masses

- **Centrally manageable fleet**: Facilitates monitoring, data analytics, and operational insights; useful for city authorities to manage informal services like auto-rickshaws
- **Sustainability & Scalability**: Built with a frugal footprint, all our products are designed for scale. Sustainability impact is at the heart of what we do, and reporting on impact metrics is built-in as a first-class citizen into all our products.
- **Interoperability and integration**: Our products are designed for native integration with public transport operations and ITS/ICCC systems. Public transport starts will now start at the doorstep!
